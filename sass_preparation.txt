Firstly, to use sass in your project you should install an environment to work with sass and compile it,
one of the most common ways is to use gulp in sass compilation,

## using gulp for sass:

1- check you have nodejs & npm on your machine:
==>> open your command screen and run < node -v && npm >
2- this will display the versions of node & npm on your machine
3- if you don't have node on your machine it will display this command not found
4- go to nodjs.org and download & install latest stable version on nodejs
5- once the download and installation have been finished 
===>> open your command screen and run again < node -v & npm -v >
6- now you can install gulp using npm command
===>> in the command screen run < npm install gulp -g >
this will download & install gulp globally on your machine but not specifically in a specific project 
7- if you will start a project you can do one of two things 
---7.1- install gulp locally in your project folder as the following
======>> open command screen inside your project folder and run 
< npm install gulp --save-dev >
this will install gulp locally inside your project and will define it as a command you can use it inside your project
---7.2- define gulp command loacally in your package.json file 

Now you have installed nodejs, npm on your machine 
and you have installed gulp even on your machine or inside your project locally based on your choice from above steps


### for gulp installation
1- after you have installed gulp check the package you need for sass 
2- you will find a most recommended package for sass called (gulp-sass)
3- open command screen inside your project folder, then run 
===>> < npm install gulp-sass --save-dev >
4- create a "gulpfile.js" in your project folder root 
5- start create your gulpfile scripts to build the sass compile task 
you can find an example in the gulp-sass doc page
< https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass >

### once you finished "gulpfile.js" open command screen in your project folder
you can run the sass task compilation by run the command
< gulp SASS_TASK_NAME > // SASS_TASK_NAME is the task name in your "gulpfile.js"
